This time Sam hardcoded the password into the script. However, the password is long and complex, and Sam is often forgetful. So he wrote a script that would email his password to him automatically in case he forgot. Here is the script:

Now this challenge is good in the sense that it also requires some common sense 

we have a button "Send password to Sam"
                 "submit"
and a password field

this time i went to inspect the source code
because there is a vulnerable script in the html source code itself

<form action="/missions/basic/4/level4.php" method="post">
    <input type="hidden" name="to" value="sam@hackthissite.org"><input type="submit" value="Send password to Sam"></form>

here in this script we can see that there is a input type="hidden" with a value value="sam@hackthissite.org" 

i did a simple modification and replaced the email address to my email address

and clicked on "Send password to sam" button which instead of sending the password to the real Sam, sent the password to me

and again i found the password

now to challenge Basic 5
