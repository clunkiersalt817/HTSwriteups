This time Network Security sam has saved the unencrypted level7 password in an obscurely named file saved in this very directory.

In other unrelated news, Sam has set up a script that returns the output from the UNIX cal command. Here is the script:

Enter the year you wish to view and hit 'view'.
 
Password:

Now to solve this challenge i just tried the unix command ls since the input field was acting like a shell

1. if no input was given then clicking on view presented us with current month and year

2. if we input month and year number it viewed month and year

3. if only year then it viewed all the months of that year

i used a semi-colon to seperate the commands for the script and it ran it to listthe directories and i got the password file

it looked something like this
