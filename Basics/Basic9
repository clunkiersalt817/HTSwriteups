This question was not very difficult but as it is written in the challenge description that this level seems a lot trickier then it actually is..

i was confused at last and then had to see the solution on the web

this happened because i thought this question didn't have any connection to the previous one but i was wrong 

also that we had to run the similar command that we used in the previous challenge i didn't even thought about that so yeah the question was trickier for me 

this line in the description also manifested confusion "script finds the first occurance of '<--', and looks to see what follows directly after it" as it does nothing and has no use

the solution was to just run the same command in the password input field 

<!--exec cmd="ls /var/www/hackthissite.org/html/missions/basic/9/"-->

we get the password file name and can enter the url to view password

now to next challenge Basic 10
