This time Network Security Sam remembered to upload the password file, but there were deeper problems than that.

Given :

A password input field and submit button

pressed ctrl+u to view source code

we have some html code

<form action="/missions/basic/3/index.php" method="post">
                     	 <input type="hidden" name="file" value="password.php" />
                     	 <input type="password" name="password" /><br /><br />
                     	 <input type="submit" value="submit" /></form>

here we can see that 

password.php file with type="hidden" can be accessed through url

i tired and voila, got the password

Now to Basic challenge 4
