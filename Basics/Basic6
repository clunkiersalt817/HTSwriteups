An encryption system has been set up, which uses an unknown algorithm to change the text given. Requirements: Persistence, some general cryptography knowledge.

Network Security Sam has encrypted his password. The encryption system is publically available and can be accessed with this form:

**Please enter a string to have it encrypted.

You have recovered his encrypted password. It is:

029g7j=<

Decrypt the password and enter it below to advance to the next level.

Password:**

now to find the code for encryption system i viewed the source code but to no avail

then did some inspecting, but nothing...

the i tried some thing with the encrypt button

i entered a string "123abc"
the output is "Your encrypted string is: '135dfh'"

again with the string "abc123"
'ace468'

so i figured out that the encription system is something like offsetting the character with the index number they are present at

hence,  1+0->1
        2+1->2
        3+2->5
        ascii of a + 3->d
        and so on

found the string and went ahead to the next challenge Basic 7
