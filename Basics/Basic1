this was the first challenge which they called as "the idiot test", and they also wrote that it is very easy
so i went ahead and tried it 

i was given a password input box and a submit button
i had to find password

this question as and well specified that it was easy i just pressed the shortcut to see the source code of the page 
scrolled down 
and was presented with password 

written something like this in plain sight

<!-- the first few levels are extremely easy: password is b9a0aac7 -->

here again it is written that it is extremely easy lol

now to next challenge Basic 2
